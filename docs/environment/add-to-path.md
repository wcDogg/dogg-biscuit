# Add to $PATH

Some tools require you to add a directory or file to your $PATH. Sometimes you can do this with an `ensurepath` command. Other times you will need to add it manually. Here's an example of how:

1. Start > Edit environment variables for your account
2. Environment Variables dialog > User Variables section
3. Select the `Path` variable > Edit
4. New: C:\Users\wcd\AppData\Roaming\Python\Scripts
