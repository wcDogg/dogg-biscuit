# Prerequisites

These are Windows-specific instructions and assume you already have the following installed & configured:

- GitHub account
- [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)
- [GitHub Cli](https://cli.github.com/)
- [PowerShell 7](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/PowerShell/scripting/install/installing-PowerShell-on-windows?view=PowerShell-7.2)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or other editor

While they're a bit messy, I have detailed notes at: [github.com/wcDogg/windows][https://github.com/wcdogg/windows].
